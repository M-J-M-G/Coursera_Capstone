    "Toronto is the capital of Ontario and is the metropolitan area with close to 3 million residents. It has the population density of 4334.4 people per square kilometer with many neighborhoods with diverse characteristics. The city has the land area of 630 square kilometers. It is needless to point out that every year the city attracts large population of visitors both for business and pleasure.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) held large population of consumers and numerous financial centers. Being such a crowded urban area mean the city held many shopping stores and social gathering places where the population is dense. The new investors tend to choose areas to establish their business with high population density of consumers with lower real estate cost and lower competition. However, the average residents mostly gravitate to areas with high social gathering venues density with lower real estate cost. The difficulty of making the decision to commit to the area to reside or invest is a major challenge and not to be taken lightly. \n",
    "\n",
    "To ease the assessment problem for new residents and entrepreneurs, we can create a map with helpful data and informative charts for real estate rates where the different neighborhoods of Toronto are clustered based on venues density.\n"
